            <strong>Coffee drinkers tend to live longer</strong>. Research has
            linking moderate consumption (about three to four cups per day) with
            a longer life span, plus a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease,
            type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's, according to Harvard Health
            Publishing.

            <strong>Finland is home to the biggest coffee lovers.</strong> The
            average adult Finn goes through 27.5 pounds of coffee each year,
            according to the International Coffee Organization. Compare that to
            a measly 11 pounds per American.

            <strong>You can overdose on coffee.</strong> Don't worry, you would
            need to drink about 30 cups in a very short period time to get close
            to a lethal dose of caffeine, Vox reports.

            One of the most coveted varieties comes from the feces of an Asian
            palm civet. The cat-like creature eats fruit including coffee
            cherries, but is unable to digest the beans. The excreted seeds
            produce a smooth, less acidic brew called kopi luwak, but the means
            of production has drawn criticism from animal welfare activists.

            <strong>Espresso means "pressed out" in Italian.</strong> This
            refers to the way espresso is made â€” forcing boiling water through
            pressed coffee grounds. And although espresso has more caffeine per
            volume than coffee, it would take three shots to equal the amount in
            a regular cup of joe.

            <strong>Only two U.S. states produce coffee.</strong> Kona coffee is
            the United States' gift to the coffee world. Because coffee
            traditionally grows best in climates along the equator, Hawaii's
            weather is optimal for harvesting beans. California also recently
            got into the coffee game with dozens of farms now churning out
            pricey premium bags.

            <strong>Brazil grows the most coffee in the world.</strong> Today,
            Brazil produces about third of the world's supply, according to the
            International Coffee Organization, about twice as much as the second
            place holder, Vietnam.
