        <strong>There is very much types of coffe.</strong>
        If you can't imagine life without coffee, you're not alone: Ree Drummond
        starts every day with a cup. There are so many popular types of coffee
        to choose from, but for Ree, cold brew is the way to go. She mastered
        the art of making perfect cold-brewed iced coffee at home years ago, and
        these days she gets growlers of the stuff from her Pawhuska, OK, shop
        and restaurant The Mercantile, so she can have a tall glass every
        morning. "To say I couldn't live without it is an understatement," she
        says. Her obsession is on full display at The Merc's café, which serves
        a bunch of different types of coffee drinks: cold brew, of course, as
        well as espresso-based drinks like cortados, cappuccinos, macchiatos,
        and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Types of Coffee Beans</strong>. Coffee is a brewed drink made
        from coffee beans, which are actually the roasted seeds of the coffee
        plant. The species of bean used, where it was sourced from, and how it
        was roasted will all affect the taste and aroma of the final cup you'll
        sip. The two main categories of coffee beans you'll come across are
        Arabica and Robusta. So what's the difference?
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Arabica</strong>. You may have seen bags of coffee labeled "100
        percent Arabica." Arabica is the most popular type of bean used for
        coffee. Arabica beans are considered higher quality than Robusta, and
        they're also more expensive. They result in coffee with a sweeter, less
        harsh taste.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Robusta</strong>. Robusta beans are typically cheaper to produce
        because the Robusta plant is easier to grow. They have a higher caffeine
        content and taste more bitter than Arabica beans. These beans are often
        used to make instant coffee and espresso blends.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Black Coffee</strong>. No frills here: Black coffee is made from
        plain ground coffee beans that are brewed hot. It's served without added
        sugar, milk, or flavorings.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Decaf</strong>. Coffee beans naturally contain caffeine, but
        roasters can use several different processes to remove almost all of it.
        Decaf coffee is brewed with these decaffeinated beans.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Espresso</strong>. Most people know that a shot of espresso is
        stronger than the same amount of coffee, but what's the difference,
        exactly? There isn't anything inherently different about the beans
        themselves, but when beans are used to make espresso they're more finely
        ground, and they're brewed with a higher grounds-to-water ratio than
        what's used for coffee. The result is a thicker, more concentrated
        liquid with a bolder flavor. A single espresso is a one-ounce shot. It's
        also the base for popular coffee-shop drinks like lattes and
        cappuccinos.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Latte</strong>. This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and
        2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam, but coffee shops
        have come up with seemingly endless customizations. You can experiment
        with flavored syrups like vanilla and pumpkin spice or create a nondairy
        version by using oat milk. Skilled baristas often swirl the foam into
        latte art!

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Cappuccino</strong>. This espresso-based drink is similar to a
        latte, but the frothy top layer is thicker. The standard ratio is equal
        parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam. It's often served in a 6-ounce
        cup (smaller than a latte cup) and can be topped with a sprinkling of
        cinnamon.

        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Macchiato</strong>. A macchiato is a shot of espresso with just
        a touch of steamed milk or foam. In Italian, macchiato means "stained"
        or "spotted," so a caffè macchiato refers to coffee that's been stained
        with milk.
